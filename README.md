# SecureWebApiCookiesExample
ASP.NET Core Web Api and Angular application exemplifying how you can secure a web api using cookies

You can run the ASP.NET Core application using the command line executing `dotnet run`.

You can run the Angular client (assuming you have all the required dependencies installed) by doing: `ng serve --open`.

You can find the blog post that describes the contents of this repository in detail [here](https://www.blinkingcaret.com/2018/07/18/secure-an-asp-net-core-web-api-using-cookies/). 

Please be aware that the examples in the blog post don't rely on ASP.NET Core Identity and that HTTP POST Requests' data is sent in the query string whereas in this repo the data is sent in the body as JSON.
